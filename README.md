# RULES

###3-5 players

###Overview
This game is inspired by the board game Coup. This game can be played with a standard 52-card deck of cards. In the beginning, players are initially dealt out three cards that only they can see themselves. The goal is simple: be the last person standing with at least one card. On each turn, if a player claims a card ability (e.g., a player assassinates another player) it automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges this ability. When challenged, if you can't reveal the appropriate card, you lose the card, turning it face-up. Face-up cards cannot be used, and if both of your cards are face-up, you're out of the game. If you do have the card in question, you reveal it, the opponent loses a card and your card gets shuffled into the deck only to draw a new one, perhaps getting the same card again and perhaps not. The last player to still have a face-down card (or two) is victorious.

###Ace card ability: assassinate
If you have an Ace, you can force an opponent to discard a card. If your opponent challenges you and you don't have an Ace, you must discard a card. If you do have an Ace, then you must discard your Ace. Ace can also block assassinations.

###6-King card ability: duel
If you have a card of value 6 to King, you can force an opponent to duel you. You and your opponent must flip one of your cards over simultaneously and whoever has the higher card wins (standard suit rankings apply). Your opponent can't challenge your duel and you must discard a card if you were bluffing. If your opponent doesn't challenge and accepts, however, then all cards are fair game. *Note: in duels, Ace is the lowest value and King is highest.*

###2-5 card ability: trade
If you have a card of value 2 to 5, you can place a card face down into the discard pile and take a new card from the top of the deck.

###2 card ability: block
If you have a 2 card, you can block assassinations.

###Suited ability: draw
If all of the cards you have are of the same suit, then you can draw a card from the deck without having to discard a card.
